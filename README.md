# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to apply what we've learned about machine learning and **nueral networks**. Based on the features within the dataset, a binary classifier will be created in order to predict *whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup*. The goal is to use the skills learned from the module to help the foundation predict where to make investments.

## Analysis/Results
The provided dataset used in this analysis is a [CSV](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-online/module_19/charity_data.csv) "containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years." 

Stepping through the deliverables, the following tasks will be performed on the data:
1. Preprocessing the data for a Nueral Network Model
2. Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model
3. Optimize the Model
